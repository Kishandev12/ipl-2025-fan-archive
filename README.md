# IPL 2025 Fan Archive

### A Digital Humanities Project on Ephemeral Sports Culture

## Overview

The IPL 2025 Fan Archive is a digital heritage project that documents, preserves, and contextualizes fan-generated discourse surrounding the 2025 Indian Premier League season. The archive captures news coverage, Reddit discussions, meme cultures, controversies, celebratory narratives, and platform-native expressions that typically disappear into algorithmic timelines.

This project treats fan culture not as noise, but as primary cultural material.

## Research Objective

The archive addresses a central digital humanities question:

How do we preserve ephemeral, platform-driven cultural production before it vanishes?

Cricket fandom in 2025 existed across Reddit threads, meme pages, comment sections, viral edits, and breaking news cycles. These materials are historically meaningful yet structurally unstable. The project documents and preserves these artifacts using archival standards.

## Archival Methodology

This project implements structured preservation practices:

• Dublin Core metadata schema for descriptive consistency
• Timestamped capture of digital artifacts
• Preservation via Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) and Archive.today
• Documentation of platform context (Reddit, news portals, social media)
• Categorization across themes: celebration, controversy, discourse, virality

Each entry is treated as an archival object, not casual content.

## Scope of Documentation

The archive includes:

• Breaking news and season-defining headlines
• Reddit discourse from r/Cricket, r/IPL, and related communities
• Meme cycles and viral reactions
• Controversies including umpiring debates and player conflicts
• Royal Challengers Bangalore’s historic IPL title
• Preserved web snapshots to prevent link rot

The goal is not exhaustiveness, but representative cultural capture.

## Technical Architecture

This archive is intentionally lightweight and preservation-friendly.

• Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• No framework dependencies
• Inline SVG graphics
• Static deployment via GitHub Pages
• Version-controlled repository for transparency

The absence of heavy frameworks ensures long-term accessibility and low digital decay risk.

## Digital Preservation Context

The project situates IPL fandom within broader themes:

• Platform ephemerality
• Algorithmic memory vs archival memory
• Vernacular discourse as cultural record
• Sports culture as contemporary folklore
• Web archiving as civic preservation

Fan memes and Reddit arguments are not trivial artifacts. They are expressions of collective emotion, identity, and community.

## Academic Framing

This project demonstrates how digital humanities methods can be applied to contemporary sports culture. It bridges:

• Archival science
• Media studies
• Platform studies
• Cultural history
• Digital preservation practice

It argues that ephemeral internet culture deserves systematic documentation.
